## Executive assessment

### Critical/high findings need prompt review

The scanner found 2 open critical/high patterns among 2 open findings\. Confirm exposure and prioritize the actions below\. Detector severity is not proof of exploitability or deployed risk\.

| Open findings | Critical/high | Affected files | Accepted baseline findings | Coverage gaps |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |

**66 active controls** still require applicability and effectiveness validation. A completed static scan or optional review cannot establish a control pass.

**User review decisions:** 42 active rules; 131 active acceptance checks. Separately recorded: 0 justified / 0 disabled rules; 1 justified / 0 disabled checks; 1 justified / 0 disabled observed findings.

Justified and disabled items are excluded from active totals without positive or negative credit. These are user decisions, not validated control passes. The complete reasons appear in **User review decisions** below.

**What the scanner found:** Secrets: 1; Tool execution: 1. These are detected pattern categories, not confirmed attack paths.

**Execution:** exit 1; severity threshold high. The exit threshold does not change the review priorities below.

**Optional model review:** disabled. This overview and the mitigation guidance work offline without a model.

## Immediate concerns and first actions

P0: critical, P1: high, P2: medium, P3: low/info\. These are deterministic review priorities based on detector severity, not incident confirmation, remediation SLAs, likelihood estimates, or residual\-risk scores\. Confidence describes the detected pattern; applicability must be checked\.

| Priority | What the scanner found | Occurrences | First action | Suggested owner |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| P1 | [AI003: Dynamic os shell command](#group-9d4abccaf43a) (final\_filesystem) | 1 | Replace os\.system/os\.popen with a fixed executable and validated argument list; trace all contributing values\. | Agent/tool developer |
| P1 | [AI010: Credential\-like literal in source or configuration](#group-2e42c7eb207c) (retained\_layer) | 1 | Determine whether the value is real without reproducing it; revoke or rotate a real exposed credential and remove retained copies through the incident process\. | Credential/service owner |

## What could reduce the risk

The layers below are **proposed and unverified**. They can reduce exposure or impact only when correctly implemented and tested. Fix the underlying issue where applicable. No suggested layer, baseline exception, or model opinion lowers a finding's recorded severity.

Before accepting lower residual risk, record deployment evidence, negative-test results, owner, review date, and expiry. Confirm that requests cannot bypass the control and retest after changes.

### AI003: Dynamic os shell command

**HIGH** · open · 1 occurrences · final\_filesystem

**Observed evidence:** [rootfs/app/dist/agent\.py:2](#finding-048583e918841128)

Packaged file in the final image filesystem; whether it executes in deployment is unverified\.

**Possible impact:** If external values contribute to the command string, the shell could execute additional commands with the server identity\.

**Address the cause:** Replace os\.system/os\.popen with a fixed executable and validated argument list; trace all contributing values\.

| Additional defense | How it could help | Evidence needed | Remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enforce action policy outside the model | Have an execution service allow only named operations, permitted argument values, and caller\-owned target resources before invoking a tool\. | Exercise disallowed operations, additional arguments, cross\-tenant identifiers, and direct calls that bypass the agent planner\. | Authorized operations can still be harmful when business constraints are incomplete; prompt instructions cannot enforce this boundary\. |
| Isolate tool execution | Run the risky tool in a separate, disposable identity with no host mounts, ambient credentials, or unnecessary outbound access\. | In a test environment, attempt reads outside the workspace, forbidden network connections, and resource exhaustion; retain policy and denial evidence\. | Isolation limits reachable assets; it does not make injected code trustworthy or rule out a runtime escape\. |

### AI010: Credential\-like literal in source or configuration

**HIGH** · open · 1 occurrences · retained\_layer

**Observed evidence:** [\.image\-metadata/retained\-layer/000001\.env:1](#finding-908179b40eae85ee)

Historical layer content remains in the distributed archive even if removed from the final filesystem\. This does not mean the file currently executes\. Real credentials can remain exposed through the retained layer\.

**Possible impact:** If the detected literal is a live credential, anyone with access to the source, image layers, or copied artifacts may use its granted permissions\.

**Address the cause:** Determine whether the value is real without reproducing it; revoke or rotate a real exposed credential and remove retained copies through the incident process\.

| Additional defense | How it could help | Evidence needed | Remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Investigate and contain confirmed secret exposure | For a real exposed credential, identify reachable systems, revoke or rotate it, and review access records for misuse\. | Confirm the old credential no longer works and record the exposure window, affected copies, and follow\-up owner\. | Successful rotation stops future use of that credential but cannot reverse access or data loss that already occurred\. |
| Use managed credential injection and revocation | Load secrets at runtime through an approved store or workload identity; keep them out of source, artifacts, and model context\. | Test rotation and revocation without disclosing values; inspect build layers and launch metadata for retained copies\. | Deleting a file or hiding a later image layer does not revoke a credential or erase copies already distributed\. |
| Limit credentials available to the workload | Give this component a distinct identity and only the downstream scopes and lifetime needed for its approved operations\. | Use its runtime identity to attempt forbidden service operations, then revoke it and confirm subsequent access fails\. | A compromised component can still use its allowed permissions until credentials expire or revocation takes effect\. |

### AI010: Credential\-like literal in source or configuration

**HIGH** · justified · 1 occurrences · runtime\_configuration

**Observed evidence:** [\.image\-metadata/environment/000000\.json:2](#finding-b1a04a9b8cb75eea)

Image configuration defaults; actual deployment settings may override them\.

**Possible impact:** If the detected literal is a live credential, anyone with access to the source, image layers, or copied artifacts may use its granted permissions\.

**Address the cause:** Determine whether the value is real without reproducing it; revoke or rotate a real exposed credential and remove retained copies through the incident process\.

### What remains unknown

- Image scope: packaged\_source\_and\_metadata; 1 packaged source files inspected\. The container was not started\. Compiled application behavior and runtime overrides are unassessed\.
- Actual reachability, deployment configuration, upstream validation, data sensitivity, and exploitability require verification\.
- Authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, tool approvals, prompt\-injection resistance, and recovery need runtime or human evidence\.
- Suggested defense layers have not been verified as deployed\. There is no calculated residual\-risk score or automatic severity reduction\.
- No dependency CVE feed or live adversarial agent/MCP benchmark was run\. Excluded and unsupported files remain outside the selected scope\.

Guidance catalog version: 1\.0\.0; SHA-256: `dadde42b9b4e7f65d34d897f716649ed0b49b1fc561e5e45a9eadbac43c5eed1`. The catalog is bundled and does not contact external sources during a scan.

## User review decisions

`justified` records the user's rationale; `disabled` excludes a check from active assessment. Neither state means pass, earns positive credit, or counts against active totals. Observed evidence remains available. Rule decisions and imported individual-finding decisions exclude related findings from the severity gate; control and individual-check decisions affect checklist review only. Scan errors and coverage gaps remain unresolved.

| Scope | Active | Justified | Disabled | Excluded with mixed check decisions | Catalog total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Rules | 42 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 42 |
| Controls | 66 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 66 |
| Checks | 131 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 132 |

### Configured decisions and reasons

| Scope | Identifier | Decision | User reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| checks | GOV\-01:1 | justified | TEST ONLY: deliberate inert fixture retained for scanner regression\. This assertion validates no production safeguard\. |
| findings | 9d4be3b23ed7a5edbf22f308 | justified | TEST ONLY: deliberate inert fixture retained for scanner regression\. This assertion validates no production safeguard\. |

Review configuration SHA-256: `8891591562a0670e29d2b4f914aaa2d54172a3d46140e47f9800c99327d16e70`.

User dispositions are not validated passes and are excluded from actionable finding and active review counts\. Rule and individual finding dispositions affect their findings; control and check dispositions affect review scope only and never waive static rule findings\. Observed evidence and operational coverage gaps remain in the report\. Shared static analysis may still collect evidence for disabled rules\.

## Methods, configuration and blind spots

Find repeatable security patterns and organize the remaining assurance work for agents, MCP servers and built images\.

| Catalog measure | Count |
|---|---:|
| Deterministic rules | 42 |
| Controls with partial static mapping | 26 |
| Controls without static mapping | 40 |
| Catalog acceptance checks | 132 |

Mapping counts describe available checks, not percent secure, detection accuracy or validated control effectiveness\.

### How the layers operate

1. Choose an explicit code/image target and scan configuration; no target code or container is started\.
2. Collect bounded deterministic evidence, record hashes, rule matches, exclusions and coverage gaps\.
3. When explicitly enabled, select bounded evidence for finding triage and every active control check; findings\-only mode narrows this step\.
4. Run advisory model requests under fixed limits; validate response schemas, known identifiers and exact evidence quotes\. The model cannot select files or execute tools through the review controller\.
5. Retain unsupported claims and runtime/human requirements; record user review decisions separately from model advice\.
6. Import an explicitly selected reviewed report with a fresh target scan; revalidate evidence bindings, retain stale decisions for audit and recompute the result\.

### What each layer can and cannot establish

#### Execution and data flow

**Deterministic:** Python AST checks with bounded local aliases/values; JavaScript/TypeScript tokens and balanced calls identify selected eval, shell, deserialization, SQL and template patterns\.

**Optional model review:** A model can explain a retrieved call path, question whether input is trusted and identify contextual concerns the pattern rules do not encode\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Cross\-file flows, dynamic imports, wrappers, reflection, generated code, unsupported languages and runtime values can hide a risk\. A dangerous API can also be intentional and correctly constrained\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Exercise actual entry points with authorized negative tests; verify input provenance, execution privileges and sandbox boundaries\.

#### MCP identity, authorization and tools

**Deterministic:** Selected configuration/code signals flag insecure transport, explicit authentication bypass, token passthrough, broad tool grants and unpinned server launch packages\.

**Optional model review:** A model can review supplied authorization logic, tool descriptions and trust\-boundary evidence for missing assumptions or inconsistent checks\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Configuration may differ from deployment\. External gateways, identity providers, token audience checks and tenant boundaries may be absent from retrieved evidence\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Test expired/wrong\-audience tokens, cross\-tenant access, per\-tool authorization, consent binding and the deployed MCP transport\.

#### Prompt injection, retrieval and memory

**Deterministic:** Selected patterns identify external content placed in privileged model messages and explicit approval/sandbox bypass\. This is not an attack simulation\.

**Optional model review:** A model can reason about untrusted\-content handling, persistent memory, tool\-output influence and missing approval boundaries in the supplied excerpts\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Adaptive attacks, multi\-turn interactions and tool chains depend on runtime behavior\. Retrieval can omit the relevant code; a model can overlook an attack or be influenced by hostile evidence\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Run isolated adversarial agent/MCP evaluations with attack\-success and legitimate\-task measurements, plus human review of consequential actions\.

#### Secrets and data handling

**Deterministic:** Selected literal credentials, plausible private\-key material, credential\-bearing URLs, logging patterns and browser credential exposure are flagged and redacted best\-effort\.

**Optional model review:** A model can identify sensitive data flows and retention concerns when the supplied evidence explains their context\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Encoded, split or runtime\-fetched credentials can be missed; labels/test values can resemble secrets\. Neither layer establishes whether a credential is live or redaction is complete\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Verify secret stores, credential rotation, logging/retention policy, egress destinations and actual data\-access permissions\.

#### Built images and supply chain

**Deterministic:** Image archives are reconstructed without starting containers; supported packaged source, metadata, retained credentials, stored permissions and package inventories are inspected\.

**Optional model review:** A model can interpret supplied image/source evidence, flag missing deployment context and propose verification work\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Compiled logic, live deployment overrides, signature trust and dependency CVEs are not assessed\. Package inventory and archive consistency do not establish safety or publisher identity\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Use vulnerability/advisory analysis, provenance/signature verification and deployment testing alongside the static image assessment\.

#### Operations and control effectiveness

**Deterministic:** The catalog retains governance, monitoring, recovery, approval and isolation checks even where no deterministic rule maps to them\.

**Optional model review:** Full review queues every active acceptance check and can identify evidence gaps or propose runtime/human validation; it can cite exact submitted source text\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** A valid citation proves that a quote exists, not that the model's interpretation is correct\. Policies, external services, incident procedures and production outcomes may be unavailable\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Record owner\-reviewed evidence, operational exercises and runtime results\. A written justification remains an accepted exception, never an automatically validated pass\.

### Recorded scan configuration

These are settings and limits, not proof of completed coverage. Current CLI flags select a fresh scan; imported reports do not execute commands, select targets, restore credentials or enable model review.

## Scan details

Scanned **4 files**; **2 open findings**, **0 suppressed findings**, and **0 coverage gaps**.

| Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Source I/O: **32 bytes read**, **32 bytes charged** against the budget, including **0 conservatively charged bytes** for failed reads. Each read reserves a sentinel byte to detect growth.

### Analysis depth

File counts describe inspected inputs, not complete semantic coverage. Syntax/read failures remain listed as coverage gaps.

| Profile | Files | Analysis scope |
|---|---:|---|
| image\_metadata | 3 | Selected image configuration/history/layer security checks; package inventory and file metadata are not application logic or CVE validation\. |
| python\_ast | 1 | Python syntax, bounded local aliases/value tracking and selected security sinks; no whole\-program or interprocedural proof\. |

Severity failure threshold: **high** · Process exit code: **1**.

## Container image

Input: **demo\-agent\.tar** · Format: **docker\-save** · Platform: **linux/amd64**.

Image config digest: sha256:4d3b0348c48a9cbf6c97239e9e3b7596cdc0e6f9a0eb02f873b3963ecd1738fd

Analysis scope: **packaged\_source\_and\_metadata** · Packaged source files inspected: **1**.

The container was not started. Paths under `rootfs/` refer to the image filesystem; `.image-metadata/` contains generated evidence from the image configuration, history, and retained layers. Packaged supported code is inspected directly. Native binary logic is not decompiled, and package inventory is not a CVE scan.

A clean pattern scan is not a control pass. Validate applicability and exploitability before remediation; runtime and manual checks remain required.

## Findings

<a id="finding-b1a04a9b8cb75eea"></a>

### AI010 — Credential\-like literal in source or configuration

**HIGH** · Confidence: medium · Status: justified

Location: \.image\-metadata/environment/000000\.json:2–2 · Finding ID: `9d4be3b23ed7a5edbf22f308`

A credential\-named field contains a nonplaceholder literal\. It may be a real secret or test data; validate it without disclosing the value\.

```text
[REDACTED: credential-related image evidence; inspect this location locally]
```

**Remediation:** If real, revoke and rotate the credential, remove it from source and history, and load it from a secret manager or environment variable with least privilege\.

**User decision:** justified (finding 9d4be3b23ed7a5edbf22f308). **Reason:** TEST ONLY: deliberate inert fixture retained for scanner regression\. This assertion validates no production safeguard\.

This observed pattern is retained for audit and excluded from active findings and the severity gate. Its recorded severity and evidence are unchanged; the user decision does not prove remediation.

Image evidence context: **runtime\_configuration**. Provenance: \{"field": "Env", "index": 0, "key": "SERVICE\_API\_KEY"\}

Location: \.image\-metadata/retained\-layer/000001\.env:1–2 · Finding ID: `e770b87231f7a7060cc1f9cc`

A credential\-named field contains a nonplaceholder literal\. It may be a real secret or test data; validate it without disclosing the value\. This credential\-like content remains in a retained image layer even though the file revision is absent from the final filesystem; this is artifact exposure, not a live source\-code finding\.

## Coverage and limitations

- The container was not started\. Image configuration can be overridden at deployment; runtime authorization, network policy, mounts, privileges and effective user are not established\.
- Packaged supported source/configuration is analyzed directly\. Native binaries, bytecode\-only applications and stripped/minified artifacts do not receive decompilation or complete application\-logic analysis\.
- Image dependency inventory is not a CVE assessment\. No vulnerability feed, signature trust policy, registry provenance, or malware engine is consulted\.
- Build history and retained\-layer credentials are image\-artifact evidence; removed source\-code defects are not reported as live application defects\.
- Static pattern and local syntax analysis do not prove exploitability, authentication, isolation, or absence of vulnerabilities\.
- Python receives AST\-based call checks; other source languages receive selected textual/configuration checks, not whole\-program dataflow\.
- No dependencies are installed, target code executed, services contacted, or CVE feed queried\.
- Default excluded directories and unsupported files remain outside the selected scan scope\.
- Prompt injection resistance, authorization, tenant separation, runtime egress, and human approval need adversarial/runtime validation\.
- Evidence redaction is best\-effort; reports and optional judge payloads can still contain sensitive code or data\.

### Inventory

Dependency manifests: 0; agent/MCP signal files: 0.

Dependency manifests are inventoried, not checked against a vulnerability database.

### Scan errors

None.

### Excluded or skipped paths

| Path | Reason | Coverage gap |
|---|---|---|

## Optional LLM judge

Disabled. No LLM request was made.
## Editable review and fresh scan

Edit only decision, reason, reviewer, reviewed_at and evidence_ref in the JSON block below. Keep IDs, bindings, subjects and origin unchanged. Save this Markdown file and pass it to a fresh scan with --review-report. JSON and SARIF expose the same editable fields; HTML provides a Download reviewed HTML button and optional PDF provides fillable fields.

Allowed decisions: empty (no decision), justified, disabled, note, needs_runtime_validation, needs_human_review. Nonempty decisions need a reason; justified/disabled decisions also need a reviewer. Evidence references are plain text, never fetched or executed. Gap records cannot waive scan failures.

Justifications are user exceptions, not validated passes. They are excluded from active counts without positive or negative credit. Evidence changes leave decisions unapplied and visible for re-review. Explicit pending runtime/human validation remains incomplete. A finding not detected on a fresh complete scan is not proof that a vulnerability was fixed.

Example: invarune /explicit/path/to/repository --review-report ./reviewed-report.md --output ./new-report
