AI agent and MCP security report

Scan ID: `ec8d6a76a741b1f3aca153be558d56010f9624db016feaaf3a2655d6b83ed4a7`

This is static security triage, not certification or proof that a system is secure.

## Executive assessment

### Incomplete scan \- close the coverage gaps

The selected static scope was not fully inspected\. There are 9 open findings, including 2 critical/high findings\. Resolve reported gaps and review existing evidence before relying on this result\.

| Open findings | Critical/high | Affected files | Accepted baseline findings | Coverage gaps |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 9 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 2 |

**66 active controls** still require applicability and effectiveness validation. A completed static scan or optional review cannot establish a control pass.

**What the scanner found:** Supply chain: 4; Output handling: 3; Secrets: 2. These are detected pattern categories, not confirmed attack paths.

**Execution:** exit 2; severity threshold high. The exit threshold does not change the review priorities below.

**Optional model review:** disabled. This overview and the mitigation guidance work offline without a model.

## Immediate concerns and first actions

P0: critical, P1: high, P2: medium, P3: low/info\. These are deterministic review priorities based on detector severity, not incident confirmation, remediation SLAs, likelihood estimates, or residual\-risk scores\. Confidence describes the detected pattern; applicability must be checked\.

**Close scan coverage gaps:** resolve the listed errors or scope limits and rerun on a stable input. Existing findings still need review.

- binary\_content: 1 entries. Examples: src/components/features/plugins/plugin\-spec\-identity\.ts
- parse\_error: JSON could not be parsed at line 33: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes; structured configuration checks were skipped\.: 1 entries. Examples: tsconfig\.json

| Priority | What the scanner found | Occurrences | First action | Suggested owner |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| P1 | [AI010: Credential\-like literal in source or configuration](#group-57a1992f928c) (source) | 2 | Determine whether the value is real without reproducing it; revoke or rotate a real exposed credential and remove retained copies through the incident process\. | Credential/service owner |
| P2 | [AI040: Unsafe HTML rendering boundary](#group-38c699676b2c) (source) | 3 | Render external output as text or apply a maintained, context\-appropriate sanitizer before the sink; verify the final rendering path\. | Frontend/rendering owner |
| P3 | [AI024: Container image is not digest pinned](#group-0cc3d39352a0) (source) | 4 | Identify the approved image digest and enforce it in the effective build or deployment while preserving a reviewed update process\. | Container/release owner |

## What could reduce the risk

The layers below are **proposed and unverified**. They can reduce exposure or impact only when correctly implemented and tested. Fix the underlying issue where applicable. No suggested layer, baseline exception, or model opinion lowers a finding's recorded severity.

Before accepting lower residual risk, record deployment evidence, negative-test results, owner, review date, and expiry. Confirm that requests cannot bypass the control and retest after changes.

### AI010: Credential\-like literal in source or configuration

**HIGH** · open · 2 occurrences · source

**Observed evidence:** [src/hooks/query/use\-backends\-health\.ts:32](#finding-7d0f8ce4de608d65), [src/hooks/query/use\-backends\-health\.ts:33](#finding-d04bd9fd3b2ee988)

Source evidence: deployment reachability and active use have not been established\.

**Possible impact:** If the detected literal is a live credential, anyone with access to the source, image layers, or copied artifacts may use its granted permissions\.

**Address the cause:** Determine whether the value is real without reproducing it; revoke or rotate a real exposed credential and remove retained copies through the incident process\.

| Additional defense | How it could help | Evidence needed | Remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Investigate and contain confirmed secret exposure | For a real exposed credential, identify reachable systems, revoke or rotate it, and review access records for misuse\. | Confirm the old credential no longer works and record the exposure window, affected copies, and follow\-up owner\. | Successful rotation stops future use of that credential but cannot reverse access or data loss that already occurred\. |
| Use managed credential injection and revocation | Load secrets at runtime through an approved store or workload identity; keep them out of source, artifacts, and model context\. | Test rotation and revocation without disclosing values; inspect build layers and launch metadata for retained copies\. | Deleting a file or hiding a later image layer does not revoke a credential or erase copies already distributed\. |
| Limit credentials available to the workload | Give this component a distinct identity and only the downstream scopes and lifetime needed for its approved operations\. | Use its runtime identity to attempt forbidden service operations, then revoke it and confirm subsequent access fails\. | A compromised component can still use its allowed permissions until credentials expire or revocation takes effect\. |

### AI040: Unsafe HTML rendering boundary

**MEDIUM** · open · 3 occurrences · source

**Observed evidence:** [src/components/features/chat/mono\-component\.tsx:6](#finding-2a87bc7e4e265d15), [src/components/features/chat/path\-component\.tsx:20](#finding-7e47da9b12caeb2c), [src/components/shared/text\-shimmer\.tsx:73](#finding-6e626e3849b44e41)

Source evidence: deployment reachability and active use have not been established\.

**Possible impact:** If unsanitized agent or tool content reaches a raw HTML sink, attacker\-controlled markup may execute in a viewer browser and access that viewer session\.

**Address the cause:** Render external output as text or apply a maintained, context\-appropriate sanitizer before the sink; verify the final rendering path\.

| Additional defense | How it could help | Evidence needed | Remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apply browser defenses around rendered output | Render data as text by default; where HTML is essential, use a maintained sanitizer and a restrictive Content Security Policy\. | Exercise active markup, event handlers, URL schemes, and sanitizer bypass regressions in the actual rendering component\. | CSP is an additional layer and can be weakened by unsafe directives; sanitization must match the eventual HTML or URL context\. |
| Isolate untrusted previews from privileged sessions | Place intentionally active external previews on a separate origin or an appropriately restricted sandbox, without application credentials or privileged messaging capabilities\. | Attempt parent\-frame access, navigation, storage access, and privileged postMessage calls from the preview; confirm explicit rejection\. | Sandbox permissions can restore dangerous authority, and origin isolation does not make downloaded content safe to execute elsewhere\. |

### AI024: Container image is not digest pinned

**LOW** · open · 4 occurrences · source

**Observed evidence:** [docker/Dockerfile:28](#finding-f647e33fd9bf0a1e), [docker/Dockerfile:52](#finding-1625e0a669478962), [helm/agent\-canvas/templates/statefulset\.yaml:48](#finding-e81a3b47b9fe5b21), [helm/agent\-canvas/values\.yaml:11](#finding-7e925c86f6715539)

Source evidence: deployment reachability and active use have not been established\.

**Possible impact:** If a mutable image tag changes, a rebuild or deployment may consume unreviewed bytes; the scan does not establish that the current image is vulnerable\.

**Address the cause:** Identify the approved image digest and enforce it in the effective build or deployment while preserving a reviewed update process\.

| Additional defense | How it could help | Evidence needed | Remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Verify artifact identity before use | Require reviewed artifact provenance plus a digest or signature checked against an independently trusted identity or manifest\. | Substitute bytes, producer identity, or verification metadata in a controlled test and confirm the consumer rejects the artifact\. | Authenticity establishes the producer and bytes; an approved producer can still ship vulnerable or malicious content\. |
| Keep pinned artifacts maintained | Review known\-vulnerability and maintenance evidence for the actual resolved artifacts and apply updates through a repeatable release process\. | Demonstrate a dependency update, relevant regression checks, and deployment or rollback of the resulting approved artifact\. | This source/image scan does not provide a current CVE verdict, and a vulnerability database cannot identify every unknown flaw\. |

### What remains unknown

- Actual reachability, deployment configuration, upstream validation, data sensitivity, and exploitability require verification\.
- Authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, tool approvals, prompt\-injection resistance, and recovery need runtime or human evidence\.
- Suggested defense layers have not been verified as deployed\. There is no calculated residual\-risk score or automatic severity reduction\.
- No dependency CVE feed or live adversarial agent/MCP benchmark was run\. Excluded and unsupported files remain outside the selected scope\.

Guidance catalog version: 1\.0\.0; SHA-256: `dadde42b9b4e7f65d34d897f716649ed0b49b1fc561e5e45a9eadbac43c5eed1`. The catalog is bundled and does not contact external sources during a scan.

## Scan details

Scanned **1233 files**; **9 open findings**, **0 suppressed findings**, and **2 coverage gaps**.

| Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 0 |

Source I/O: **7487391 bytes read**, **7487391 bytes charged** against the budget, including **0 conservatively charged bytes** for failed reads. Each read reserves a sentinel byte to detect growth.

### Analysis depth

File counts describe inspected inputs, not complete semantic coverage. Syntax/read failures remain listed as coverage gaps.

| Profile | Files | Analysis scope |
|---|---:|---|
| configuration\_lexical | 9 | Selected text/configuration patterns; YAML anchors, block\-scalar semantics and dynamic templates are not fully resolved\. |
| generic\_text | 1 | Generic secret, URL and applicable text signals only; language\-specific execution and dataflow are not analyzed\. |
| javascript\_lexical | 1215 | Bounded JavaScript/TypeScript tokens, calls and configuration signals; not a full JS/TS parser or control\-flow analysis\. |
| json\_structured | 8 | Parsed JSON/JSONC fields and selected configuration rules; runtime values and referenced files are not resolved\. |

Severity failure threshold: **high** · Process exit code: **2**.

A clean pattern scan is not a control pass. Validate applicability and exploitability before remediation; runtime and manual checks remain required.

## Coverage and limitations

- Static pattern and local syntax analysis do not prove exploitability, authentication, isolation, or absence of vulnerabilities\.
- Python receives AST\-based call checks; other source languages receive selected textual/configuration checks, not whole\-program dataflow\.
- No dependencies are installed, target code executed, services contacted, or CVE feed queried\.
- Default excluded directories and unsupported files remain outside the selected scan scope\.
- Prompt injection resistance, authorization, tenant separation, runtime egress, and human approval need adversarial/runtime validation\.
- Evidence redaction is best\-effort; reports and optional judge payloads can still contain sensitive code or data\.

### Inventory
