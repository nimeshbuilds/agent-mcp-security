## Executive assessment

### Incomplete scan \- close the coverage gaps

The selected static scope was not fully inspected\. There are 9 open findings, including 2 critical/high findings\. Resolve reported gaps and review existing evidence before relying on this result\.

| Open findings | Critical/high | Affected files | Accepted baseline findings | Coverage gaps |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 9 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 3 |

**66 active controls** still require applicability and effectiveness validation. A completed static scan or optional review cannot establish a control pass.

**Fix guidance:** 9/9 observed findings have a deterministic fix plan and agent/MCP context. Model fix plans: 0/0 finding assessments and 0/0 answered checks. These are proposed changes requiring verification.

**What the scanner found:** Supply chain: 4; Output handling: 3; Secrets: 2. These are detected pattern categories, not confirmed attack paths.

**Execution:** exit 2; severity threshold high. The exit threshold does not change the review priorities below.

**Optional model review:** disabled. This overview and the mitigation guidance work offline without a model.

## Immediate concerns and first actions

P0: critical, P1: high, P2: medium, P3: low/info\. These are deterministic review priorities based on detector severity, not incident confirmation, remediation SLAs, likelihood estimates, or residual\-risk scores\. Confidence describes the detected pattern; applicability must be checked\.

**Close scan coverage gaps:** resolve the listed errors or scope limits and rerun on a stable input. Existing findings still need review.

- binary\_content: 1 entries. Examples: src/components/features/plugins/plugin\-spec\-identity\.ts
- parse\_error: Instruction\-threat inspection is bounded to 1000000 characters for source metadata; remaining instruction/tool metadata needs review\.: 1 entries. Examples: src/i18n/translation\.json
- parse\_error: JSON could not be parsed at line 33: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes; structured configuration checks were skipped\.: 1 entries. Examples: tsconfig\.json

| Priority | What the scanner found | Occurrences | First action | Suggested owner |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| P1 | [AI010: Credential\-like literal in source or configuration](#group-57a1992f928c) (source) | 2 | Determine whether the value is real without reproducing it; revoke or rotate a real exposed credential and remove retained copies through the incident process\. | Credential/service owner |
| P2 | [AI040: Unsafe HTML rendering boundary](#group-38c699676b2c) (source) | 3 | Render external output as text or apply a maintained, context\-appropriate sanitizer before the sink; verify the final rendering path\. | Frontend/rendering owner |
| P3 | [AI024: Container image is not digest pinned](#group-0cc3d39352a0) (source) | 4 | Identify the approved image digest and enforce it in the effective build or deployment while preserving a reviewed update process\. | Container/release owner |

## What could reduce the risk

The layers below are **proposed and unverified**. They can reduce exposure or impact only when correctly implemented and tested. Fix the underlying issue where applicable. No suggested layer, baseline exception, or model opinion lowers a finding's recorded severity.

Before accepting lower residual risk, record deployment evidence, negative-test results, owner, review date, and expiry. Confirm that requests cannot bypass the control and retest after changes.

### AI010: Credential\-like literal in source or configuration

**HIGH** · open · 2 occurrences · source

**Observed evidence:** [src/hooks/query/use\-backends\-health\.ts:32](#finding-7d0f8ce4de608d65), [src/hooks/query/use\-backends\-health\.ts:33](#finding-d04bd9fd3b2ee988)

Source evidence: deployment reachability and active use have not been established\.

**Possible impact:** If the detected literal is a live credential, anyone with access to the source, image layers, or copied artifacts may use its granted permissions\.

**Address the cause:** Determine whether the value is real without reproducing it; revoke or rotate a real exposed credential and remove retained copies through the incident process\.

| Additional defense | How it could help | Evidence needed | Remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Investigate and contain confirmed secret exposure | For a real exposed credential, identify reachable systems, revoke or rotate it, and review access records for misuse\. | Confirm the old credential no longer works and record the exposure window, affected copies, and follow\-up owner\. | Successful rotation stops future use of that credential but cannot reverse access or data loss that already occurred\. |
| Use managed credential injection and revocation | Load secrets at runtime through an approved store or workload identity; keep them out of source, artifacts, and model context\. | Test rotation and revocation without disclosing values; inspect build layers and launch metadata for retained copies\. | Deleting a file or hiding a later image layer does not revoke a credential or erase copies already distributed\. |
| Limit credentials available to the workload | Give this component a distinct identity and only the downstream scopes and lifetime needed for its approved operations\. | Use its runtime identity to attempt forbidden service operations, then revoke it and confirm subsequent access fails\. | A compromised component can still use its allowed permissions until credentials expire or revocation takes effect\. |

### AI040: Unsafe HTML rendering boundary

**MEDIUM** · open · 3 occurrences · source

**Observed evidence:** [src/components/features/chat/mono\-component\.tsx:6](#finding-2a87bc7e4e265d15), [src/components/features/chat/path\-component\.tsx:20](#finding-7e47da9b12caeb2c), [src/components/shared/text\-shimmer\.tsx:73](#finding-6e626e3849b44e41)

Source evidence: deployment reachability and active use have not been established\.

**Possible impact:** If unsanitized agent or tool content reaches a raw HTML sink, attacker\-controlled markup may execute in a viewer browser and access that viewer session\.

**Address the cause:** Render external output as text or apply a maintained, context\-appropriate sanitizer before the sink; verify the final rendering path\.

| Additional defense | How it could help | Evidence needed | Remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apply browser defenses around rendered output | Render data as text by default; where HTML is essential, use a maintained sanitizer and a restrictive Content Security Policy\. | Exercise active markup, event handlers, URL schemes, and sanitizer bypass regressions in the actual rendering component\. | CSP is an additional layer and can be weakened by unsafe directives; sanitization must match the eventual HTML or URL context\. |
| Isolate untrusted previews from privileged sessions | Place intentionally active external previews on a separate origin or an appropriately restricted sandbox, without application credentials or privileged messaging capabilities\. | Attempt parent\-frame access, navigation, storage access, and privileged postMessage calls from the preview; confirm explicit rejection\. | Sandbox permissions can restore dangerous authority, and origin isolation does not make downloaded content safe to execute elsewhere\. |

### AI024: Container image is not digest pinned

**LOW** · open · 4 occurrences · source

**Observed evidence:** [docker/Dockerfile:28](#finding-f647e33fd9bf0a1e), [docker/Dockerfile:52](#finding-1625e0a669478962), [helm/agent\-canvas/templates/statefulset\.yaml:48](#finding-e81a3b47b9fe5b21), [helm/agent\-canvas/values\.yaml:12](#finding-7b059b90d01eaf09)

Source evidence: deployment reachability and active use have not been established\.

**Possible impact:** If a mutable image tag changes, a rebuild or deployment may consume unreviewed bytes; the scan does not establish that the current image is vulnerable\.

**Address the cause:** Identify the approved image digest and enforce it in the effective build or deployment while preserving a reviewed update process\.

| Additional defense | How it could help | Evidence needed | Remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Verify artifact identity before use | Require reviewed artifact provenance plus a digest or signature checked against an independently trusted identity or manifest\. | Substitute bytes, producer identity, or verification metadata in a controlled test and confirm the consumer rejects the artifact\. | Authenticity establishes the producer and bytes; an approved producer can still ship vulnerable or malicious content\. |
| Keep pinned artifacts maintained | Review known\-vulnerability and maintenance evidence for the actual resolved artifacts and apply updates through a repeatable release process\. | Demonstrate a dependency update, relevant regression checks, and deployment or rollback of the resulting approved artifact\. | This source/image scan does not provide a current CVE verdict, and a vulnerability database cannot identify every unknown flaw\. |

### What remains unknown

- Actual reachability, deployment configuration, upstream validation, data sensitivity, and exploitability require verification\.
- Authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, tool approvals, prompt\-injection resistance, and recovery need runtime or human evidence\.
- Suggested defense layers have not been verified as deployed\. There is no calculated residual\-risk score or automatic severity reduction\.
- No dependency CVE feed or live adversarial agent/MCP benchmark was run\. Excluded and unsupported files remain outside the selected scope\.

Guidance catalog version: 1\.0\.0; SHA-256: `1bd48fd16d4fe76ae3ccd1cacddce9bea2dedd0000856d61b21ffb8ba8c5dd7b`. The catalog is bundled and does not contact external sources during a scan.

## Metrics and how they are calculated

No defensible universal security percentage can be calculated from static patterns or model opinions. Zero findings and 100% answered checks do not mean secure or compliant.

| Measure | Result | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Open deterministic findings | 9 | Observed patterns requiring review; 2 critical/high. No severity weights or estimated compromise probability are assigned. |
| Partial deterministic mapping reach | 45.45% (30/66) | Active selected controls with at least one active selected mapped rule. This is available partial coverage, not a pass rate. |
| Optional AI answer coverage | 0.00% (0/132) | Active selected checks with an actual model answer, including concerns and unknowns. This is review completion, not a pass rate. |

**Selected scope:** 47 rules (47 active), 66 controls (66 active), 132 active acceptance checks. The selected static scope is incomplete. Recorded coverage gaps: 3.

**Mapping formula:** 100 × active selected controls with at least one active selected mapped rule / active selected controls\. This describes partial rule availability, not completed tests, passes, or control effectiveness\.

**AI answer formula:** 100 × unique active selected acceptance checks with a received, valid model answer / active selected acceptance checks\. An answer can be a concern or an explicit unknown\. Disabled AI has zero answered checks; an empty denominator is not applicable \(null\), never 100%\.

**Optional AI:** disabled; finding stage disabled; control stage disabled.

| Advisory check outcome | Count |
|---|---:|
| supported\_by\_code | 0 |
| potential\_gap | 0 |
| needs\_runtime\_validation | 0 |
| needs\_human\_review | 0 |
| insufficient\_evidence | 0 |
| not\_applicable\_proposed | 0 |
| not\_reviewed | 132 |

Supported by code and proposed non\-applicability are advisory interpretations\. Runtime/human validation and missing evidence remain unresolved\. AI cannot erase findings, lower their severity, change the severity gate, or turn checks into passes\.

Justified and disabled rules/checks are excluded from active metric denominators without pass credit\. Findings with user decisions or baseline suppressions remain visible outside open\-finding counts\. Selection narrows the requested scope; it does not establish the excluded system is safe\.

The existing CLI gate uses open deterministic findings at or above the configured severity\. Scan/review/export errors can make requested work incomplete\. Coverage percentages and model opinions never dismiss the gate\.

## Methods, configuration and blind spots

Find repeatable security patterns and organize the remaining assurance work for agents, MCP servers, skills and built images\.

| Selected scope measure | Count |
|---|---:|
| Selected deterministic rules | 47 |
| Selected controls with partial static mapping | 30 |
| Selected controls without static mapping | 36 |
| Selected acceptance checks | 132 |
| Rules available in the full catalog | 47 |
| Controls available in the full catalog | 66 |

Mapping counts describe available checks, not percent secure, detection accuracy or validated control effectiveness\.

### How the layers operate

1. Choose an explicit code/image target and scan configuration; no target code or container is started\.
2. Collect bounded deterministic evidence, record hashes, rule matches, exclusions and coverage gaps\.
3. When explicitly enabled, select bounded evidence for finding triage and every active control check; findings\-only mode narrows this step\.
4. Run advisory requests under fixed limits\. The default full analyst may request only validated file\-ID/line ranges from an already captured, hash\-verified snapshot; no arbitrary file reads or target tools execute\. Validate response schemas, known identifiers and exact quotes\.
5. Retain unsupported claims and runtime/human requirements; record user review decisions separately from model advice\.
6. Import an explicitly selected reviewed report with a fresh target scan; revalidate evidence bindings, retain stale decisions for audit and recompute the result\.

### What each layer can and cannot establish

#### Execution and data flow

**Deterministic:** Python AST checks propagate selected registered\-tool inputs and same\-file arguments/returns, retain aliases and exact literal constraints, and check selected execution/file/network sinks\. JavaScript tokens support narrow registerTool callbacks and direct\-return named/arrow wrappers\. Explicit world\-writable chmod modes are checked\.

**Optional model review:** A model can form a trust\-boundary hypothesis, request bounded captured source ranges to inspect callers or guards, seek counterevidence and explain what the supplied code still cannot establish\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Cross\-file flows, unknown decorators/methods, complex JavaScript wrappers, dynamic imports, reflection, generated code and runtime values can hide a risk\. Recognized resource/binding failures remain gaps\. A dangerous API can be intentional and correctly constrained\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Exercise actual entry points with authorized negative tests; verify input provenance, execution privileges and sandbox boundaries\.

#### MCP identity, authorization and tools

**Deterministic:** Selected configuration/code signals flag insecure transport, explicit authentication bypass, token passthrough, broad tool grants and unpinned server launch packages\.

**Optional model review:** A model can review supplied authorization logic, tool descriptions and trust\-boundary evidence for missing assumptions or inconsistent checks\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Configuration may differ from deployment\. External gateways, identity providers, token audience checks and tenant boundaries may be absent from retrieved evidence\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Test expired/wrong\-audience tokens, cross\-tenant access, per\-tool authorization, consent binding and the deployed MCP transport\.

#### Prompt injection, retrieval and memory

**Deterministic:** Selected patterns identify external content placed in privileged model messages and explicit approval/sandbox bypass\. This is not an attack simulation\.

**Optional model review:** A model can reason about untrusted\-content handling, persistent memory, tool\-output influence and missing approval boundaries in the supplied excerpts\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Adaptive attacks, multi\-turn interactions and tool chains depend on runtime behavior\. Retrieval can omit the relevant code; a model can overlook an attack or be influenced by hostile evidence\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Run isolated adversarial agent/MCP evaluations with attack\-success and legitimate\-task measurements, plus human review of consequential actions\.

#### Secrets and data handling

**Deterministic:** Selected literal credentials, plausible private\-key material, credential\-bearing URLs, logging patterns and browser credential exposure are flagged and redacted best\-effort\.

**Optional model review:** A model can identify sensitive data flows and retention concerns when the supplied evidence explains their context\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Encoded, split or runtime\-fetched credentials can be missed; labels/test values can resemble secrets\. Neither layer establishes whether a credential is live or redaction is complete\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Verify secret stores, credential rotation, logging/retention policy, egress destinations and actual data\-access permissions\.

#### Skills and malicious\-tool indicators

**Deterministic:** Bounded skill/tool/schema descriptions are checked for instruction hijacking, sensitive\-data transfer, covert or approval\-bypassing actions\. Selected Spanish/French/German overrides and paired authority claims supplement English predicates\. Python read\-only tool annotations are compared with recognized direct write witnesses\.

**Optional model review:** A model can review intent, indirect social engineering, skill reference context and tool behavior visible in retrieved evidence, including cases where syntax or supported patterns are inconclusive\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** A pattern is risk evidence, not proof of malicious authorship\. Obfuscation, remote references, external packages, omitted context and runtime behavior can evade either layer\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Inspect publisher provenance and the exact installed skill/tool; test consequential actions in an authorized isolated environment and verify effective permissions\.

#### Built images and supply chain

**Deterministic:** Image archives are reconstructed without starting containers; supported packaged source, metadata, retained credentials, stored permissions and package inventories are inspected\.

**Optional model review:** A model can interpret supplied image/source evidence, flag missing deployment context and propose verification work\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Compiled logic, live deployment overrides, signature trust and dependency CVEs are not assessed\. Package inventory and archive consistency do not establish safety or publisher identity\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Use vulnerability/advisory analysis, provenance/signature verification and deployment testing alongside the static image assessment\.

#### Operations and control effectiveness

**Deterministic:** The catalog retains governance, monitoring, recovery, approval and isolation checks even where no deterministic rule maps to them\.

**Optional model review:** Full review queues every active acceptance check and can identify evidence gaps or propose runtime/human validation; it can cite exact submitted source text\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** A valid citation proves that a quote exists, not that the model's interpretation is correct\. Policies, external services, incident procedures and production outcomes may be unavailable\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Record owner\-reviewed evidence, operational exercises and runtime results\. A written justification remains an accepted exception, never an automatically validated pass\.

## Scan details

Scanned **1233 files**; **9 open findings**, **0 suppressed findings**, and **3 coverage gaps**.

| Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 0 |

Source I/O: **7487391 bytes read**, **7487391 bytes charged** against the budget, including **0 conservatively charged bytes** for failed reads. Each read reserves a sentinel byte to detect growth.

### Analysis depth

File counts describe inspected inputs, not complete semantic coverage. Syntax/read failures remain listed as coverage gaps.

| Profile | Files | Analysis scope |
|---|---:|---|
| configuration\_lexical | 9 | Selected text/configuration patterns; YAML anchors, block\-scalar semantics and dynamic templates are not fully resolved\. |
| generic\_text | 1 | Generic secret/URL signals, bounded English skill/instruction directives and selected Spanish/French/German override forms; no general translation\. Language\-specific execution/dataflow is not analyzed\. |
| javascript\_lexical | 1215 | Bounded JavaScript/TypeScript tokens, calls, configuration and direct\-return function\-wrapper summaries; not a full JS/TS parser or control\-flow analysis\. |
| json\_structured | 8 | Parsed JSON/JSONC fields, selected configuration rules and recognized tool/input\-schema descriptions; runtime values and referenced files are not resolved\. |

Severity failure threshold: **high** · Process exit code: **2**.

A clean pattern scan is not a control pass. Validate applicability and exploitability before remediation; runtime and manual checks remain required.

A credential\-named field contains a nonplaceholder literal\. It may be a real secret or test data; validate it without disclosing the value\.

```text

```

**Remediation:** If real, revoke and rotate the credential, remove it from source and history, and load it from a secret manager or environment variable with least privilege\.

#### Fix plan and agent/MCP relevance

Classify the detected credential, rotate real exposure and remove embedded values\.

**Why this matters for agents/MCP:** A hardcoded model, gateway or downstream\-tool key can grant access outside the intended agent session and tenant\. Repository or image readers may obtain the credential independently of the agent approval path\.

Inspect the reported source location and its callers, change the implementation or effective configuration, then rebuild and rescan\. The scan does not establish that this code is on an active agent or MCP request path\.

**Confirm applicability:**

- Determine whether the value is a real credential, a nonsecret identifier or deliberate test data without copying the value into tickets or model prompts\.
- The detector does not validate the credential with its provider and does not establish prior misuse\.

| Step | Concrete change | Verify it |
|---|---|---|
| 1\. Revoke or rotate confirmed live credentials | Identify the credential owner and permissions using secret\-safe metadata\. Revoke or rotate real exposed credentials with a staged application update and review provider audit records\. | Verify the old credential is rejected and the replacement has only required model/tool scopes; retain redacted rotation evidence\. |
| 2\. Remove literals from delivery artifacts | Replace the literal with a secret\-manager lookup or runtime injection\. Remove it from tracked files, distributed image layers and relevant build artifacts; coordinate any history rewrite with repository owners\. | Rescan the source and every retained image layer, and check logs/build artifacts for the old credential through a protected secret\-scanning workflow\. |
| 3\. Limit future credential reach | Use separate per\-service or per\-tenant credentials where supported and restrict which tool workers receive them\. Exclude local secret files from version control and build contexts\. | Run a tool that does not need the credential and verify it cannot read it; confirm clean builds do not embed injected build secrets\. |

**Remaining validation:**

- Deleting source text does not invalidate a copied credential; rotation and access review remain necessary\.
- Environment injection can still expose secrets through process inheritance or diagnostics\.

**Remediation:** Render untrusted output as text or sanitize with a maintained HTML policy before using a raw\-HTML sink; apply a restrictive content security policy\.

#### Fix plan and agent/MCP relevance

Render agent/tool output as text or apply a maintained HTML sanitization policy\.

**Confirm applicability:**

- Confirm whether a maintained sanitizer already processes the exact value and whether later transformations can reintroduce markup\.
- Some applications intentionally support rich HTML; a raw sink alone does not prove exploitable XSS\.

Keep URL and attribute handling appropriate to their specific context\. | Render script tags, event\-handler attributes and HTML\-looking tool output and verify they appear as text without executing\. |
| 2\. Sanitize required rich content | Where HTML is necessary, apply a maintained sanitizer such as DOMPurify with a narrow tag/attribute/URL policy immediately before the sink\. Avoid mutating sanitized HTML through unsafe downstream transformations\. | Test script/event attributes, dangerous URL schemes and SVG/MathML edge cases relevant to the chosen policy in the actual rendering environment\. |
| 3\. Add independent browser controls | Deploy a restrictive Content Security Policy and appropriate frame/session controls, and keep the sanitizer and DOM implementation patched\. Do not use CSP as a substitute for correct rendering\. | Verify representative injected markup cannot execute in the deployed page and legitimate formatting still works; inspect policy violations and sanitizer regression results\. |

Record the intended platform or multi\-platform index\. | Resolve the approved reference through the build/deployment system and verify the running image digest matches the recorded artifact/platform\. |

## Coverage and limitations

- Static pattern and local syntax analysis do not prove exploitability, authentication, isolation, or absence of vulnerabilities\.
- Python receives AST\-based call checks; other source languages receive selected textual/configuration checks, not whole\-program dataflow\.
- No dependencies are installed, target code executed, services contacted, or CVE feed queried\.
- Default excluded directories and unsupported files remain outside the selected scan scope\.
- Prompt injection resistance, authorization, tenant separation, runtime egress, and human approval need adversarial/runtime validation\.
- Evidence redaction is best\-effort; reports and optional judge payloads can still contain sensitive code or data\.

### Inventory

Dependency manifests: 3; agent/MCP signal files: 5.

Dependency manifests are inventoried, not checked against a vulnerability database.

### Scan errors

- src/i18n/translation\.json: Instruction\-threat inspection is bounded to 1000000 characters for source metadata; remaining instruction/tool metadata needs review\.
- tsconfig\.json: JSON could not be parsed at line 33: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes; structured configuration checks were skipped\.

### Excluded or skipped paths

| Path | Reason | Coverage gap |
|---|---|---|
| electron/loading\.html | unsupported\_extension | outside scope |
| src/components/features/plugins/plugin\-spec\-identity\.ts | binary\_content | yes |
| src/index\.css | unsupported\_extension | outside scope |
| src/tailwind\.css | unsupported\_extension | outside scope |

## Optional LLM judge

Disabled. No LLM request was made.
## Editable review and fresh scan

Edit only decision, reason, reviewer, reviewed_at and evidence_ref in the JSON block below. Keep IDs, bindings, subjects and origin unchanged. Save this Markdown file and pass it to a fresh scan with --review-report. JSON and SARIF expose the same editable fields; HTML provides a Download reviewed HTML button and optional PDF provides fillable fields.

Allowed decisions: empty (no decision), justified, disabled, note, needs_runtime_validation, needs_human_review. Nonempty decisions need a reason; justified/disabled decisions also need a reviewer. Evidence references are plain text, never fetched or executed. Gap records cannot waive scan failures.

Justifications are user exceptions, not validated passes. They are excluded from active counts without positive or negative credit. Evidence changes leave decisions unapplied and visible for re-review. Explicit pending runtime/human validation remains incomplete. A finding not detected on a fresh complete scan is not proof that a vulnerability was fixed.

Example: invscan /explicit/path/to/repository --review-report ./reviewed-report.md --output ./new-report
