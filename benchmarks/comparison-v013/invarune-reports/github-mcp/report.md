## Executive assessment

### Open findings need investigation

The scanner found 15 open patterns, with no open critical/high detections\. Review applicability, address the causes, and validate the proposed defenses\.

| Open findings | Critical/high | Affected files | Accepted baseline findings | Coverage gaps |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 15 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

**66 active controls** still require applicability and effectiveness validation. A completed static scan or optional review cannot establish a control pass.

**Fix guidance:** 15/15 observed findings have a deterministic fix plan and agent/MCP context. Model fix plans: 0/0 finding assessments and 0/0 answered checks. These are proposed changes requiring verification.

**What the scanner found:** Supply chain: 15. These are detected pattern categories, not confirmed attack paths.

**Execution:** exit 0; severity threshold high. The exit threshold does not change the review priorities below.

**Optional model review:** disabled. This overview and the mitigation guidance work offline without a model.

## Immediate concerns and first actions

P0: critical, P1: high, P2: medium, P3: low/info\. These are deterministic review priorities based on detector severity, not incident confirmation, remediation SLAs, likelihood estimates, or residual\-risk scores\. Confidence describes the detected pattern; applicability must be checked\.

| Priority | What the scanner found | Occurrences | First action | Suggested owner |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| P3 | [AI025: Direct dependency is not exactly pinned](#group-35a2b5731941) (source) | 15 | Check the effective install command and lockfile; enforce a verified resolution and document intentionally flexible development declarations\. | Dependency/build owner |

## What could reduce the risk

The layers below are **proposed and unverified**. They can reduce exposure or impact only when correctly implemented and tested. Fix the underlying issue where applicable. No suggested layer, baseline exception, or model opinion lowers a finding's recorded severity.

Before accepting lower residual risk, record deployment evidence, negative-test results, owner, review date, and expiry. Confirm that requests cannot bypass the control and retest after changes.

### AI025: Direct dependency is not exactly pinned

**LOW** · open · 15 occurrences · source

**Observed evidence:** [ui/package\.json:17](#finding-885fd1ff8c680557), [ui/package\.json:18](#finding-e2aa2242d12f944e), [ui/package\.json:19](#finding-0eeb21b69e1f8516), [ui/package\.json:20](#finding-5b02dd257b15d5ed), [ui/package\.json:21](#finding-eab38ca94c25e0b1), [ui/package\.json:22](#finding-016b4e22b5b27798), [ui/package\.json:23](#finding-10892c7058ebee51), [ui/package\.json:24](#finding-b70e2107b958086e), [ui/package\.json:27](#finding-471abcedf1bf7a9c), [ui/package\.json:28](#finding-6d032baac500bca9), [ui/package\.json:29](#finding-8043529f7815dfb7), [ui/package\.json:30](#finding-17950c92824cb6b1), [ui/package\.json:31](#finding-3f4472e98ae31597), [ui/package\.json:32](#finding-5814efbb2feef3f1), [ui/package\.json:33](#finding-e62299abdd2414e5)

Source evidence: deployment reachability and active use have not been established\.

**Possible impact:** If the actual install is not constrained by an enforced lockfile or hash, dependency versions may change without a corresponding reviewed source change\.

**Address the cause:** Check the effective install command and lockfile; enforce a verified resolution and document intentionally flexible development declarations\.

| Additional defense | How it could help | Evidence needed | Remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resolve and install reviewed dependency bytes | Use a committed lock or approved artifact manifest, enforce it during installation, and retain the resolved dependency inventory\. | Build in a clean environment and compare resolved bytes; modify a lock or artifact and verify the release gate rejects it\. | An exact version or digest can still identify a vulnerable artifact; mutable transitive dependencies must also be constrained\. |
| Keep pinned artifacts maintained | Review known\-vulnerability and maintenance evidence for the actual resolved artifacts and apply updates through a repeatable release process\. | Demonstrate a dependency update, relevant regression checks, and deployment or rollback of the resulting approved artifact\. | This source/image scan does not provide a current CVE verdict, and a vulnerability database cannot identify every unknown flaw\. |

Guidance sources (engineering synthesis): [CISA\-SECURE\-BY\-DESIGN](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design); [NIST\-SSDF](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final); [OPENSSF\-BASELINE\-202608](https://baseline.openssf.org/versions/2026-08-28); [OPENSSF\-SCORECARD](https://securityscorecards.dev/)

### What remains unknown

- Actual reachability, deployment configuration, upstream validation, data sensitivity, and exploitability require verification\.
- Authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, tool approvals, prompt\-injection resistance, and recovery need runtime or human evidence\.
- Suggested defense layers have not been verified as deployed\. There is no calculated residual\-risk score or automatic severity reduction\.
- No dependency CVE feed or live adversarial agent/MCP benchmark was run\. Excluded and unsupported files remain outside the selected scope\.

Guidance catalog version: 1\.0\.0; SHA-256: `dadde42b9b4e7f65d34d897f716649ed0b49b1fc561e5e45a9eadbac43c5eed1`. The catalog is bundled and does not contact external sources during a scan.

## Methods, configuration and blind spots

Find repeatable security patterns and organize the remaining assurance work for agents, MCP servers and built images\.

| Catalog measure | Count |
|---|---:|
| Deterministic rules | 42 |
| Controls with partial static mapping | 26 |
| Controls without static mapping | 40 |
| Catalog acceptance checks | 132 |

Mapping counts describe available checks, not percent secure, detection accuracy or validated control effectiveness\.

### How the layers operate

1. Choose an explicit code/image target and scan configuration; no target code or container is started\.
2. Collect bounded deterministic evidence, record hashes, rule matches, exclusions and coverage gaps\.
3. When explicitly enabled, select bounded evidence for finding triage and every active control check; findings\-only mode narrows this step\.
4. Run advisory model requests under fixed limits; validate response schemas, known identifiers and exact evidence quotes\. The model cannot select files or execute tools through the review controller\.
5. Retain unsupported claims and runtime/human requirements; record user review decisions separately from model advice\.
6. Import an explicitly selected reviewed report with a fresh target scan; revalidate evidence bindings, retain stale decisions for audit and recompute the result\.

### What each layer can and cannot establish

#### Execution and data flow

**Deterministic:** Python AST checks with bounded local aliases/values; JavaScript/TypeScript tokens and balanced calls identify selected eval, shell, deserialization, SQL and template patterns\.

**Optional model review:** A model can explain a retrieved call path, question whether input is trusted and identify contextual concerns the pattern rules do not encode\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Cross\-file flows, dynamic imports, wrappers, reflection, generated code, unsupported languages and runtime values can hide a risk\. A dangerous API can also be intentional and correctly constrained\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Exercise actual entry points with authorized negative tests; verify input provenance, execution privileges and sandbox boundaries\.

#### MCP identity, authorization and tools

**Deterministic:** Selected configuration/code signals flag insecure transport, explicit authentication bypass, token passthrough, broad tool grants and unpinned server launch packages\.

**Optional model review:** A model can review supplied authorization logic, tool descriptions and trust\-boundary evidence for missing assumptions or inconsistent checks\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Configuration may differ from deployment\. External gateways, identity providers, token audience checks and tenant boundaries may be absent from retrieved evidence\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Test expired/wrong\-audience tokens, cross\-tenant access, per\-tool authorization, consent binding and the deployed MCP transport\.

#### Prompt injection, retrieval and memory

**Deterministic:** Selected patterns identify external content placed in privileged model messages and explicit approval/sandbox bypass\. This is not an attack simulation\.

**Optional model review:** A model can reason about untrusted\-content handling, persistent memory, tool\-output influence and missing approval boundaries in the supplied excerpts\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Adaptive attacks, multi\-turn interactions and tool chains depend on runtime behavior\. Retrieval can omit the relevant code; a model can overlook an attack or be influenced by hostile evidence\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Run isolated adversarial agent/MCP evaluations with attack\-success and legitimate\-task measurements, plus human review of consequential actions\.

#### Secrets and data handling

**Deterministic:** Selected literal credentials, plausible private\-key material, credential\-bearing URLs, logging patterns and browser credential exposure are flagged and redacted best\-effort\.

**Optional model review:** A model can identify sensitive data flows and retention concerns when the supplied evidence explains their context\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Encoded, split or runtime\-fetched credentials can be missed; labels/test values can resemble secrets\. Neither layer establishes whether a credential is live or redaction is complete\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Verify secret stores, credential rotation, logging/retention policy, egress destinations and actual data\-access permissions\.

#### Built images and supply chain

**Deterministic:** Image archives are reconstructed without starting containers; supported packaged source, metadata, retained credentials, stored permissions and package inventories are inspected\.

**Optional model review:** A model can interpret supplied image/source evidence, flag missing deployment context and propose verification work\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** Compiled logic, live deployment overrides, signature trust and dependency CVEs are not assessed\. Package inventory and archive consistency do not establish safety or publisher identity\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Use vulnerability/advisory analysis, provenance/signature verification and deployment testing alongside the static image assessment\.

#### Operations and control effectiveness

**Deterministic:** The catalog retains governance, monitoring, recovery, approval and isolation checks even where no deterministic rule maps to them\.

**Optional model review:** Full review queues every active acceptance check and can identify evidence gaps or propose runtime/human validation; it can cite exact submitted source text\.

**Can miss or misclassify:** A valid citation proves that a quote exists, not that the model's interpretation is correct\. Policies, external services, incident procedures and production outcomes may be unavailable\.

**Runtime/human evidence:** Record owner\-reviewed evidence, operational exercises and runtime results\. A written justification remains an accepted exception, never an automatically validated pass\.

### Recorded scan configuration

## Scan details

Scanned **156 files**; **15 open findings**, **0 suppressed findings**, and **0 coverage gaps**.

| Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 |

Source I/O: **2086786 bytes read**, **2086786 bytes charged** against the budget, including **0 conservatively charged bytes** for failed reads. Each read reserves a sentinel byte to detect growth.

### Analysis depth

File counts describe inspected inputs, not complete semantic coverage. Syntax/read failures remain listed as coverage gaps.

| Profile | Files | Analysis scope |
|---|---:|---|
| configuration\_lexical | 1 | Selected text/configuration patterns; YAML anchors, block\-scalar semantics and dynamic templates are not fully resolved\. |
| generic\_text | 136 | Generic secret, URL and applicable text signals only; language\-specific execution and dataflow are not analyzed\. |
| javascript\_lexical | 12 | Bounded JavaScript/TypeScript tokens, calls and configuration signals; not a full JS/TS parser or control\-flow analysis\. |
| json\_structured | 7 | Parsed JSON/JSONC fields and selected configuration rules; runtime values and referenced files are not resolved\. |

Severity failure threshold: **high** · Process exit code: **0**.

A clean pattern scan is not a control pass. Validate applicability and exploitability before remediation; runtime and manual checks remain required.

### AI025 — Direct dependency is not exactly pinned

**LOW** · Confidence: low · Status: open

Location: ui/package\.json:17–17 · Finding ID: `7b0fae91f2cabbd6a542b53c`

A direct dependency declaration allows version movement\. A lockfile elsewhere may constrain the actual installation; review the effective build process\. Dependency: @github/markdown\-toolbar\-element\. A lockfile may pin its resolved version\.

```text
    "@github/markdown-toolbar-element": "^2.2.3",
```

**Remediation:** Use a committed verified lockfile or exact pins and hashes, scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities, and review updates\.

#### Fix plan and agent/MCP relevance

Make the effective dependency installation reproducible and reviewed\.

**Why this matters for agents/MCP:** Agent SDKs, MCP libraries and tool dependencies execute inside the application trust boundary\. Uncontrolled dependency changes can alter prompt handling, authentication or tool behavior with the same source revision\.

Inspect the reported source location and its callers, change the implementation or effective configuration, then rebuild and rescan\. The scan does not establish that this code is on an active agent or MCP request path\.

**Confirm applicability:**

- A version range in a package manifest may be intentionally constrained by a committed lockfile used in the actual build\.
- Exact direct pins alone do not freeze transitive dependencies, build tooling or package artifacts\.

| Step | Concrete change | Verify it |
|---|---|---|
| 1\. Identify the real resolver input | Inspect the installation command, supported lockfile and package indexes\. Use the ecosystem frozen/locked installation mode; for Python pip, exact requirements with verified hashes can constrain the complete set\. | Install from an empty controlled cache using the production build command and verify it does not rewrite the lockfile or resolve unexpected versions\. |
| 2\. Verify artifact integrity and origin | Record integrity information for transitive packages as supported by the toolchain and restrict package sources\. Review build hooks and package\-name confusion risks\. | Change an expected artifact/hash in a test mirror and verify installation fails before package code is used\. |
| 3\. Review updates and known vulnerabilities | Automate proposed dependency updates and run separate dependency\-vulnerability and agent/MCP integration tests against the resulting lock\. | Verify an update changes only the reviewed dependency set and retain results for the exact installed versions\. |

**Remaining validation:**

- A locked malicious package remains malicious, and a reproducible install is not evidence of absence of known vulnerabilities\.

**Remediation:** Use a committed verified lockfile or exact pins and hashes, scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities, and review updates\.

#### Fix plan and agent/MCP relevance

**Confirm applicability:**

- A version range in a package manifest may be intentionally constrained by a committed lockfile used in the actual build\.
- Exact direct pins alone do not freeze transitive dependencies, build tooling or package artifacts\.

| Step | Concrete change | Verify it |
|---|---|---|
| 1\. Identify the real resolver input | Inspect the installation command, supported lockfile and package indexes\. Use the ecosystem frozen/locked installation mode; for Python pip, exact requirements with verified hashes can constrain the complete set\. | Install from an empty controlled cache using the production build command and verify it does not rewrite the lockfile or resolve unexpected versions\. |
| 2\. Verify artifact integrity and origin | Record integrity information for transitive packages as supported by the toolchain and restrict package sources\.

Partial static rules: AI026, AI041
- [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/basic/authorization)

### AUTH\-02: Authorize the exact action and target

Category: Identity and authorization · Status: no\_pattern\_detected · Validation: hybrid

Partial static coverage only; absence of a finding is not a pass

### AUTH\-04: Prevent token passthrough and confused deputy use

Category: Identity and authorization · Status: no\_pattern\_detected · Validation: hybrid

Partial static coverage only; absence of a finding is not a pass

- [ ] Use audience\-bound MCP credentials and separately authorized downstream credentials; never forward arbitrary caller tokens\.
- [ ] Ensure a proxy cannot use its broader service identity to perform an action the caller cannot authorize\.

Partial static rules: AI028
- [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/basic/authorization)
- [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/2026-07-28/tutorials/security/security_best_practices)

### AUTH\-05: Constrain credential lifetime and exposure

Category: Identity and authorization · Status: no\_pattern\_detected · Validation: hybrid

Partial static coverage only; absence of a finding is not a pass

- [ ] Treat repository text and model verdicts as untrusted; test prompt injection, fabricated locations, invalid JSON, and timeouts\.
- [ ] Compare against labeled cases, retain deterministic results, document model variability, and never equate a judge approval with control validation\.

### TEST\-09: Evaluate model\-layer attacks for hosted or customized models

Category: Security validation · Status: runtime\_validation\_required · Validation: dynamic

Not established by this static scan

- [ ] Where applicable, assess suspicious triggers, model extraction, and disclosure of private training examples under an explicit attacker access and query budget\.
- [ ] Retest acquired or retrained models and adapters before release; document measured failures, model identity, coverage limits, and accepted residual risk\.

## Coverage and limitations

- Static pattern and local syntax analysis do not prove exploitability, authentication, isolation, or absence of vulnerabilities\.
- Python receives AST\-based call checks; other source languages receive selected textual/configuration checks, not whole\-program dataflow\.
- No dependencies are installed, target code executed, services contacted, or CVE feed queried\.
- Default excluded directories and unsupported files remain outside the selected scan scope\.
- Prompt injection resistance, authorization, tenant separation, runtime egress, and human approval need adversarial/runtime validation\.
- Evidence redaction is best\-effort; reports and optional judge payloads can still contain sensitive code or data\.

### Inventory

Dependency manifests: 4; agent/MCP signal files: 67.

Dependency manifests are inventoried, not checked against a vulnerability database.

### Scan errors

None.

## Optional LLM judge

Disabled. No LLM request was made.
## Editable review and fresh scan

Edit only decision, reason, reviewer, reviewed_at and evidence_ref in the JSON block below. Keep IDs, bindings, subjects and origin unchanged. Save this Markdown file and pass it to a fresh scan with --review-report. JSON and SARIF expose the same editable fields; HTML provides a Download reviewed HTML button and optional PDF provides fillable fields.

Allowed decisions: empty (no decision), justified, disabled, note, needs_runtime_validation, needs_human_review. Nonempty decisions need a reason; justified/disabled decisions also need a reviewer. Evidence references are plain text, never fetched or executed. Gap records cannot waive scan failures.

Justifications are user exceptions, not validated passes. They are excluded from active counts without positive or negative credit. Evidence changes leave decisions unapplied and visible for re-review. Explicit pending runtime/human validation remains incomplete. A finding not detected on a fresh complete scan is not proof that a vulnerability was fixed.

Example: invscan /explicit/path/to/repository --review-report ./reviewed-report.md --output ./new-report
